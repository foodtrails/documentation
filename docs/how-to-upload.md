# Uploading Documents

## Overview

Uploading of documents is how FoodTrails gets the information it uses to determine locality and purchase details.

## Supported File Types

The platform currently supports the following file formats for upload:

- CSV files (comma-separated values)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls)

:::note
Currently, only suppliers with established data pipelines can have their reports fully processed. If your supplier is not yet onboarded, you can still upload reports but they will not successfully process and you will see a Failure
