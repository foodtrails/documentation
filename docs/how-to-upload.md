# Uploading Documents

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for uploading procurement data and velocity reports to the FoodTrails platform.

## Overview

FoodTrails allows users to upload velocity reports from suppliers to track local food procurement. The platform automatically processes, standardizes, and analyzes this data to provide insights into local food purchasing patterns.

## Supported File Types

The platform currently supports the following file formats for upload:

- CSV files (comma-separated values)
- Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls)
- PDF documents (velocity reports)

:::note
Currently, only suppliers with established data pipelines can have their reports fully processed. If your supplier is not yet onboarded, you can still upload reports for manual review.
