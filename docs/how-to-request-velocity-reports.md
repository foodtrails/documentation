# How to request velocity reports

Velocity reports (also called usage or purchase history reports) are itemized reports of your SFA's purchases from a vendor for a given period. You can request these from vendors using the template below.

## Download the template

**[Download the velocity report request template](/files/velocity-report-request-template.txt)** — Use this letter to request a comprehensive, itemized velocity report from your vendors.

## Template contents

When you send the request, ask for as many of these fields as the vendor can provide:

- Vendor Name (indicated on report or in column)
- Purchase Dates or Date Range (indicated on report or in column)
- Invoice Date
- Invoice Number
- Receiving Facility, Customer, and/or District Name
- Item Name / Description
- Supplier Name (Source Farmer, Manufacturer/Processor, and/or Brand)
- Production State
- Production Address (if available)
- Pack Size
- Price Per Unit
- Units Received
- Item Number or SKU (if available)
- Item GTIN, UPC, or EAN (if available)
- Domestically Produced (Y/N)

The template letter also explains that you want all purchases (not just local), spreadsheet format (.xlsx or .csv), and that you will request these reports monthly. Vendors can send what they have even if some fields are missing.
