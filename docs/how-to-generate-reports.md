# Generating Reports

## Overview

The Reports section allows you to generate detailed analytics and insights from your procurement data. You can create custom reports, export data for external analysis, and track key performance indicators across your food purchasing activities. Report generation is the most powerful feature within FoodTrails.

Reports are meant to be dense information which can be further filtered on their own outside of the FoodTrails platform for detailed analysis about purchases, location spend, and purchases by tag.

## Accessing Reports

### From the Main Navigation

- Log in to your FoodTrails account
- Navigate to "Dashboard"
- Select "Generate Report"

## Report Types

### Standard Reports

- **Spend by Locality -- Full Purchase Details**: Most detailed report, provided breakdown grouped by facility of line item level purchases and the dollar value spent within each location category.
- **Spend by Locality**: Shows purchase spend breakdown by each facility and the dollar value associated with each location category, does not show the detailed line items which make up the sum of those dollar values
- **Local Purchases Only**: Line item details of local purchases only broken down by facility
- **Regional Purchases Only**: Line item details of regional purchases only broken down by facility
- **Purchases by Supplier**:  Groups purchases by supplier at a line item level. Displays the quantity of each item purchased under the supplier

### Basic Filters

- **Date Range**: Filter by custom or preset date ranges. It is important to note that many times the date of purchase is approximate, as the source document may be from a monthly purchase history
- **Facility Selection**: In the event that you are assigned to multiple facilities you may select which facilities you would like to be included in the report
